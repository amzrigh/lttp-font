# Overview
Inspired by other replica fonts, but left wanting by their severely limited (though game-complete) character maps, and sometimes sloppy proportions, I have, on a couple of occasions, taken it upon myself to try and improve upon them, extending them far beyond the one or two character sets they contained before.

This font is very much a work in progress. It's also a project I picked back up after not touching it for four years, so I'm finding a lot of my old work needing fixing, both because I've learned some things, and because FontForge is more strict now. There's a lot to be done and re-done.

Also, I'm kind of a novice at this. If you're an expert, I would welcome advice. I knew typesetting could be complex, but it's throwing warnings at me over what seems like really simple stuff, and I don't know what I can do about it.

I'll look into publishing a release once I've completed this revision pass and finished out the block I'm on.

### Names
I haven't decided on a name for this font yet. I have a number of candidates; some I'm considering more seriously than others. In no particular order:

- **Seven Sages Seal**
- **Zelda is Your**
- **Golden Power**
- **Evil's Bane**
- **The King's Permission**
